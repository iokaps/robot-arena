## Quick Tips for Success

### 🎮 **Gameplay Tips**

- **First time?** Run a practice round so players understand the controls
- **Explain the arena** - Show how a 60-second round works
- **Encourage strategy** - Programming is the fun part, take time with it!

### 📺 **Presenter Display Tips**

- Use a **large screen (40"+ TV or projector)** - More exciting for spectators
- **Position screen** where all players can see
- **Stand near screen** - You can narrate battles and add excitement

### 👥 **Player Management Tips**

## Support & Questions

If players ask about:

- **"How do I move my robot?"** → They use the programming buttons (Move Forward, Rotate Left/Right, Shoot, Wait)
- **"What happens if two robots crash?"** → Both stay in place, neither moves
- **"Can I change my move?"** → No - programs must be submitted before execution phase
- **"How do I win?"** → Last robot standing wins! Eliminate all others by shooting
