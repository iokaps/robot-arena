  # Welcome to Code-A-Bot Arena!

  **Program your robot. Battle your friends. Only one bot survives.**

  ## How It Works

  1. 🤖 Each player controls a robot on a 10x10 grid
  2. ⏱️ You have 30 seconds to program 5 moves
  3. ⚡ All robots execute their programs simultaneously
  4. 💥 Last bot standing wins!

  ## Commands

  - **Move Forward** - Move one cell in facing direction
  - **Rotate Left/Right** - Turn 90 degrees
  - **Shoot** - Fire a laser (instant hit-scan)
  - **Wait** - Stay put this turn

  # How to Play Code-A-Bot Arena

  ## Goal
  Be the last robot standing! Eliminate all other robots by shooting them.

  ## Game Flow
  1. **Programming Phase** (30 seconds)
     - Drag or tap commands to program your next 5 moves
     - Plan carefully - you can't change once submitted!

  2. **Execution Phase**
     - All robots execute their programs simultaneously
     - Watch the chaos unfold on the presenter screen

  3. **Repeat** until one robot remains

  ## Commands

  | Command | Effect |
  |---------|--------|
  | ↑ Move | Move forward one cell |
  | ↺ Rotate Left | Turn 90° counter-clockwise |
  | ↻ Rotate Right | Turn 90° clockwise |
  | ⊕ Shoot | Fire a laser in facing direction |
  | ◷ Wait | Do nothing this turn |

  ## Rules
  - Each robot has **3 lives**
  - Getting hit by a laser removes 1 life
  - Robots that collide both stop moving
  - Lasers are blocked by obstacles and other robots

  ## Tips
  - Predict where opponents will move
  - Use obstacles for cover
  - Sometimes waiting is the best strategy!
